  # Service definition for Consul cluster with a minimum of 3 nodes.
  # For local development we use Compose v2 so that we have an automatically
  # created user-defined network and internal DNS for the name "consul".
  # Nodes will use Docker DNS for the service (passed in via the CONSUL
  # env var) to find each other and bootstrap the cluster.
  # Note: Unless CONSUL_DEV is set, at least three instances are required for quorum.
